Coding Interview Questions
1. Let and Const use ______ scoping.
   Block
3. An array inside of an array is called what?
   Nested array
5. Describe a ternary and describe its syntax?
   A ternary operator is an operator that takes in 3 operands. The ternary operator in javascript acts as a shortened if statement. Two examples are below
   var result = CONDITIONAL ? IF_TRUE : IF_FALSE
   var result = ( height > 5 ) ? 'You are tall enough to ride!' : 'Sorry, you are too short!'
   
   Here, the result is set to the second operand if the first operand/conditon is true and set to the third operand if the first operand/condition is false.
